Include a very brief writeup of the results you got applying associative arrays to solving a problem. For example, if you did Lempel-Ziv, you might run it on several different input texts and discuss how much the algorithm compresses the data. You can include the writeup as a markdown file in your repository.

I used the associative arrays to implement Lempel-Ziv Compression.
I also created a function to calculate the compression ratio which is the size of the initial text divided by the size of the compressed text. A compression ratio above 1 indicates that the compressed text is smaller than the original text. I didn't do much benchmarking, but I tested my function with a couple different texts. As expected, for short text such as a single sentence the compression ratio is pretty bad since there's not enough repeats to really make it worth the compression. A line of repeated characters (e.g. "AAAAA...") gets a compression ratio >1 around 29 repeats. I also tried compressing the text of the bee movie script and got a ratio of ~0.927 which is interesting since I expected to get a >1 compression ratio because it is such a long text.
